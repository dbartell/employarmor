# Target Prospect List — Healthcare, Finance, Staffing

**Why these industries:**
- Use AI hiring tools but WON'T build compliance software
- Already compliance-minded (HIPAA, SEC, etc.)
- Budget for compliance solutions
- High-volume hiring = more pain

---

## 🏥 HEALTHCARE (Highest Priority)

Healthcare companies are PERFECT because:
- Already deal with HIPAA compliance = understand regulatory burden
- High-volume hiring (nurses, techs, admin)
- Use AI tools for screening volume
- Will NEVER build AI hiring compliance internally

## 💬 STAFFING AGENCY MESSAGE (New)

```
Hey [Name],

Quick question — is [Company] using any AI tools for candidate screening or matching?

Staffing agencies are getting hit by the new AI hiring laws (Colorado Feb 1, NYC already active). Since you're placing candidates across multiple clients, compliance applies to YOUR screening process, not just your clients'.

Most agencies I've talked to didn't realize this applies to them directly.

Want me to send over a breakdown of what staffing companies specifically need to do?
```

## 💬 HEALTHCARE MESSAGE (New)

```
Hey [Name],

If [Hospital/Company] uses any AI in your hiring process — screening software, assessments, chatbots — new state laws require compliance documentation.

I know healthcare HR is already drowning in HIPAA and credentialing. This is another layer, but it's actually pretty manageable if you know what's required.

Put together a quick guide specifically for healthcare TA teams. Want me to send it over?
