## COLORADO URGENCY (Feb 1 Deadline)

### Message 1 — HireVue User in Colorado
```
Hey [Name],

Noticed [Company] is hiring in Colorado and using HireVue for interviews.

Quick heads up — Colorado's AI Act kicks in Feb 1. Video interview analysis = "high-risk AI" under the law. You'll need impact assessments + candidate notifications before then.

Not selling anything — just seeing a lot of HR teams scrambling on this. Want me to send over a quick compliance checklist?
```

### Message 2 — Generic Colorado Company
```
Hey [Name],

Saw [Company] has roles open in Colorado. If you're using any AI in your hiring process (resume screening, assessments, chatbots), the Colorado AI Act takes effect Feb 1.

Requirements are pretty specific — impact assessments, notification language, appeal processes.

Happy to share a checklist we put together if helpful. No strings attached.
```

### Message 3 — Colorado + Assessment Tools
```
Hey [Name],

Colorado's AI Act deadline is 30 days out. Noticed [Company] hires there.

Quick question — are you using any pre-hire assessments or automated screening? Those likely qualify as "high-risk AI" under the new law.

I've been helping companies prep — happy to do a quick (free) check on what might apply to your stack.
```

### Message 4 — Colorado Tech Company
```
Hey [Name],

[Company] hiring in Colorado? The AI Act hitting Feb 1 is catching a lot of tech companies off guard.

If you're using AI anywhere in hiring — even just ATS screening features — you're probably covered.

Put together a quick compliance guide. Want me to send it over?
```

### Message 5 — Colorado Deadline Urgency
```
Hey [Name],

31 days until Colorado's AI Act takes effect. Saw [Company] is actively hiring there.

Most HR teams I've talked to are scrambling because they didn't realize their existing tools count as "AI" under the law.

Want me to do a quick audit of what might apply? Takes 10 minutes and might save you a headache in February.
```

## NYC LOCAL LAW 144 (Bias Audit Required)

### Message 6 — NYC Company Using AI Screening
```
Hey [Name],

If [Company] uses any AI or automated tools for screening candidates in NYC, you likely need an annual bias audit under Local Law 144.

A lot of companies don't realize their ATS or assessment tools count as "AEDTs" under the law.

I can do a quick (free) check on your tools if helpful — just takes 5 minutes.
```

### Message 7 — NYC + HireVue/Video
```
Hey [Name],

Noticed [Company] is in NYC. Quick one — if you're using video interview analysis (HireVue, etc.), that's covered under Local Law 144.

You need a third-party bias audit + public posting of results.

Happy to share a list of auditors and what to expect. Want me to send it over?
```

### Message 8 — NYC Enterprise
```
Hey [Name],

NYC's Local Law 144 has been enforced since July 2023, but I'm still seeing companies get tripped up.

If [Company] uses any automated scoring or screening in hiring — even features built into your ATS — you need annual bias audits.

Curious if this is on your radar? Happy to share what we're seeing companies do.
```

## ILLINOIS (AIVI + BIPA)

### Message 9 — Illinois Video Interviews
```
Hey [Name],

If [Company] uses AI video interview analysis for Illinois candidates, you need written consent under the AIVI Act before the interview.

It's been law since 2020 but enforcement is ramping up.

Want me to send over a compliant consent template? Free to use.
```

### Message 10 — Illinois Biometrics
```
Hey [Name],

Quick compliance check — if [Company] collects any biometric data from Illinois candidates (facial recognition, voice prints), BIPA requires written consent + a retention policy.

Penalties are steep — $1-5K per violation with private right of action.

Happy to share a compliance checklist if this is relevant.
```

## TOOL-SPECIFIC OUTREACH

### Message 11 — Workday User
```
Hey [Name],

Saw [Company] uses Workday. Quick heads up — if you have any AI features enabled (Skills Cloud, candidate matching), those may require compliance documentation under new state laws.

Colorado + NYC both have requirements now. More states coming.

Want me to send a breakdown of what Workday features trigger what? Put together a guide for this.
```

### Message 12 — Greenhouse User
```
Hey [Name],

Noticed [Company] uses Greenhouse. Good news — the core ATS is generally lower risk.

But if you've added any AI integrations (sourcing tools, assessments, chatbots), those might need attention for Colorado/NYC compliance.

Happy to do a quick audit of your stack if helpful.
```

### Message 13 — Pymetrics User
```
Hey [Name],

Saw [Company] uses Pymetrics for assessments. Those neuroscience games = AEDT under NYC law and high-risk AI under Colorado.

You'll need bias audits (NYC) and impact assessments (Colorado) documented.

Want me to send over what the requirements look like specifically for Pymetrics?
```

### Message 14 — Multiple AI Tools
```
Hey [Name],

[Company] looks like you've built a solid TA tech stack — [Tool 1], [Tool 2].

Quick question: have you mapped those to the new AI hiring laws? Colorado (Feb 1) and NYC both have requirements that apply to most of these tools.

Happy to share a compliance matrix we built showing which tools trigger what.
```

### Message 15 — Chatbot/Paradox User
```
Hey [Name],

If [Company] uses Paradox/Olivia (or any screening chatbot), heads up — those count as AEDTs in NYC and high-risk AI in Colorado.

Chatbots that filter or qualify candidates = regulated.

Want me to share what compliance looks like for conversational AI?
```

## INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC

### Message 16 — Healthcare/Regulated Industry
```
Hey [Name],

Healthcare + AI hiring compliance is getting complicated. [Company] hiring in Colorado or NYC?

Beyond the general AI laws, there are extra considerations for healthcare employers.

Put together a guide specifically for healthcare TA teams. Want me to send it over?
```

### Message 17 — Tech/Startup
```
Hey [Name],

Fast-growing tech companies are getting hit hardest by the new AI hiring laws — lots of AI tools, hiring in multiple states.

If [Company] is using AI in hiring and scaling into Colorado or NYC, might be worth a quick compliance check.

Happy to do a free audit — takes 10 min.
```

### Message 18 — Financial Services
```
Hey [Name],

Financial services + AI hiring = extra scrutiny from regulators.

If [Company] uses any AI screening tools, the new state laws (Colorado, NYC) add to your existing compliance burden.

Want me to share what we're seeing in finserv? Built a guide specifically for the industry.
```

## GENERAL/SOFT TOUCH

### Message 19 — Thought Leadership Angle
```
Hey [Name],

Been writing about AI hiring compliance — it's a mess right now. 8 states have laws, more coming, and most HR teams don't know what applies.

Saw [Company] is scaling hiring. Curious if this is on your radar or if you're sorting it out as you go?

Either way, happy to share what we're seeing.
```

### Message 20 — Network/Referral Ask
```
Hey [Name],

Working on AI hiring compliance — helping HR teams navigate the new state laws (Colorado, NYC, Illinois).

Not sure if it's relevant for [Company], but figured I'd reach out since you're well-connected in the HR space.

Know anyone struggling with this? Happy to be a resource.
```
