## 💬 SMALL COMPANY MESSAGE (Adjusted)

### For staffing agency owners:
```
Hey [Name],

Quick question — do you use any AI or automated tools for candidate screening at [Company]?

New state laws (Colorado Feb 1, NYC already active) require compliance documentation for AI hiring tools. Most small staffing agencies I've talked to didn't realize this applies to them.

Since you're placing candidates for clients, it's YOUR screening process that needs to comply, not theirs.

Happy to share a quick breakdown — takes 5 min to read. Might save you a headache.
```

### For small healthcare/clinics:
```
Hey [Name],

If [Practice/Company] uses any software to screen job applicants — even just basic ATS filtering — new Colorado laws (Feb 1) might require documentation.

I know small practices don't have time for compliance paperwork. Put together a quick checklist specifically for smaller healthcare employers.

Want me to send it over? No strings attached.
```

### For credit unions/small banks:
```
Hey [Name],

Quick compliance heads up — if [Credit Union] uses any automated tools in hiring (screening software, assessments), new Colorado laws kick in Feb 1.

Given you already deal with NCUA compliance, figured this might be on your radar. Or maybe not yet — most small FIs I've talked to haven't heard about it.

Want me to send a quick summary of what applies?
```

## 🔍 HOW TO FIND SMALL COMPANY OWNERS

**LinkedIn:**
- Search "[Company name]" + "Owner" OR "Founder" OR "President"
- For staffing: often the owner is the main face
- For healthcare: look for "Practice Manager" or "Administrator"

**Google:**
- "[Company name] owner Denver"
- Often find local news mentions, chamber of commerce profiles

**Direct approach:**
- Small companies = call the main number
- "Hi, who handles HR/hiring? Can I speak with them?"
- Often get the owner directly
