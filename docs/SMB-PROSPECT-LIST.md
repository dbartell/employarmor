## 💬 SMB-SPECIFIC MESSAGE VARIATIONS

### For startups/small teams (under 100):
```
Hey [Name],

Quick one — [Company] hiring in Colorado? The AI Act kicks in Feb 1 and a lot of smaller teams are getting caught off guard.

If you're using any AI in hiring (even just ATS features), there are new requirements.

Happy to share a quick checklist — takes 5 min to review. No strings attached.
```

### For mid-market without compliance team:
```
Hey [Name],

Saw [Company] is scaling — congrats on the growth.

Quick heads up: if you're using any AI hiring tools (assessments, screening, chatbots), new state laws require compliance documentation.

Most companies your size don't have a dedicated compliance person for this. Happy to share what we're seeing others do.
```

### For NYC companies specifically:
```
Hey [Name],

If [Company] uses any automated screening tools for NYC candidates, you need an annual bias audit under Local Law 144.

The law's been active since 2023 but enforcement is ramping up. A lot of 200-500 person companies are just now realizing this applies to them.

Want me to send a quick breakdown of what's required?
```

## 🎯 IDEAL SMB PROFILE

**Best targets:**
- 75-300 employees (big enough to use tools, small enough to lack compliance team)
- Series A-C funded (has budget, is scaling)
- Hiring 5+ roles currently (active pain point)
- Tech or healthcare industry (more likely to use AI tools)
- Colorado or NYC HQ/hiring (regulatory pressure)

**Signals they use AI hiring tools:**
- Greenhouse or Lever careers page
- Job posts mention "assessment" or "video interview"
- Using HireVue, Pymetrics, Paradox (check job descriptions)
- Fast-growing with high-volume roles

**Red flags (skip these):**
- Under 30 employees (probably not using AI tools yet)
- Over 500 employees (has internal compliance)
- No current job openings (not actively hiring)
- Founder still doing all hiring (too small)
