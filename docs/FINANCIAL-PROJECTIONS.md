## Key Assumptions & Risks

### Assumptions

2. Additional states pass similar laws (2-3/year)
3. AI hiring tool adoption continues growing
4. No major competitor emerges with VC funding
5. Product-market fit achieved in Year 1

### Risks
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Law enforcement weak | Lower urgency | Focus on training/CYA value |
| Big HR player builds | Competition | Speed, integrations, specialization |
| Slow adoption | Lower revenue | Pivot to services/consulting |
| High churn | Lower LTV | Improve product, add stickiness |
| Regulatory changes | Feature obsolescence | Stay ahead, advisory board |

## Summary

| Metric | Conservative | Base | Aggressive |
|--------|--------------|------|------------|
| **Year 1 ARR** | $120K | $360K | $840K |
| **Year 3 ARR** | $1.0M | $3.5M | $9.0M |

**Bottom line:** Even the conservative case builds a $3M ARR business. The base case creates a $50M+ exit opportunity in 5 years.
