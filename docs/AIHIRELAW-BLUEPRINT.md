- **Capital:** $0-2K (bootstrap)
- **Time:** 30-40 hours/week (AI-leveraged)

## 1. BUSINESS MODEL SELECTION

### THE ONE Model: **Productized Service → Micro-SaaS Hybrid**

**Why this model for AIHireLaw specifically:**

1. **Regulatory urgency creates demand NOW** — Colorado AI Act hits Feb 1, 2026. Companies are panicking. They'll pay for done-for-you solutions.

2. **High willingness to pay** — Compliance = avoiding $20K+ fines. A $299/mo tool or $3K service is nothing.

3. **AI does 80% of delivery** — Document generation, research, templates are all AI-executable. You're packaging AI output as expertise.

4. **Natural upsell path** — Start with DIY tools ($99/mo), upsell to done-for-you ($2-5K), upsell to ongoing retainer ($500/mo).

5. **Acquisition-attractive** — SaaS metrics + service revenue = best of both worlds for acquirers.

Hey [Name],

Saw [Company] is hiring in Colorado — quick heads up that the Colorado AI Act kicks in Feb 1. If you're using any AI in hiring (ATS screening, assessments, video interviews), you'll need impact assessments and candidate notifications.

Not trying to pitch anything — just seeing a lot of HR teams caught off guard. Happy to share a compliance checklist if helpful.

## 8. WHAT KILLS ONE-PERSON BUSINESSES

### Trap #1: Scope Creep

**What it looks like:** "Can you also review our entire HR policy?" "Can you join our weekly compliance calls?"

**How to prevent:**
- Crystal clear scope document signed before work starts
- "That's outside our scope, but I can refer you to [lawyer/consultant]"
- Fixed-price packages, not hourly

### Trap #2: Underpricing

**What it looks like:** Charging $500 for a package that takes 6 hours because "I'm new"

**How to prevent:**
- Price on value, not time: "$3K vs $20K fine is a no-brainer"
- Raise prices every 5 clients until you get pushback
- Never discount more than 20% (even for testimonials)

### Trap #3: Custom Everything

**What it looks like:** Building custom features for each client, one-off documents

**How to prevent:**
- Productized packages only
- "We don't do custom, but our Pro tier includes X"
- If 3+ clients ask for something, build it into the product

### Trap #4: Bad Clients

**Red flags:**
- "Can we just do a quick call to pick your brain?"
- Excessive questions before paying
- Negotiating price before understanding value
- "We need this yesterday"

**How to prevent:**
- Qualification questions in intake form
- Require payment before work starts
- Fire fast: refund and move on

### Trap #5: Overcomplicating

**What it looks like:** Building features no one asked for, 47-step onboarding

**How to prevent:**
- Only build what paying customers request
- Minimum viable everything
- "What's the simplest version that delivers value?"

## 10. THE REALITY CHECK

### What Will Actually Happen

**Month 1:** 
- Platform basics working
- 5-10 outreach conversations
- Maybe 1-2 small sales ($200-500)
- Lots of "interesting, but not right now"

**Month 3:**
- 10-20 paying clients
- $2-4K MRR
- First done-for-you package complete
- 1-2 testimonials
- SEO starting to drive inbound

**Month 6:**
- 40-60 paying clients
- $6-10K MRR  
- Consistent inbound from SEO
- Referrals starting
- Process documented and repeatable

**Month 12:**
- 80-120 paying clients
- $10-15K MRR ($120-180K ARR)
- Inbound > outbound
- Considering first hire or acquisition interest

### Time Investment Reality

**Building phase (Month 1-2):**
- Product development: 20 hrs/week
- Content/marketing: 10 hrs/week
- Sales/outreach: 10 hrs/week
- **Total: 40 hrs/week**

**Growth phase (Month 3-6):**
- Product improvements: 10 hrs/week
- Content/marketing: 10 hrs/week
- Sales/outreach: 10 hrs/week
- Client delivery: 10 hrs/week
- **Total: 40 hrs/week**

**Scale phase (Month 6-12):**
- Product: 5 hrs/week
- Marketing: 10 hrs/week
- Sales: 5 hrs/week
- Delivery: 15 hrs/week
- Operations: 5 hrs/week
- **Total: 40 hrs/week** (but higher revenue per hour)

### What You're Underestimating

1. **Sales cycle length** — Enterprise takes 2-6 months. Start with SMB.
2. **Support load** — Compliance = anxious customers = lots of questions
3. **Content volume needed** — SEO takes 50+ posts to see real traffic

### What Will Be Harder Than Expected

1. **Differentiation** — "Why you vs. a law firm?" (Answer: speed, price, AI-powered)
2. **Trust** — Compliance is scary. People want credentials. (Solution: testimonials, case studies, auditor partnerships)
3. **Churn** — After they're compliant, do they keep paying? (Solution: ongoing monitoring, regulatory updates)

### When to Pivot vs. Persist

**Pivot if:**
- 100+ outreaches, 0 responses (message problem)
- 10+ calls, 0 sales (offer problem)
- 3 months, <$1K MRR (market problem)

**Persist if:**
- Getting responses but not closing (sales process, iterate)
- Closing but slow (normal, keep going)
- Customers love it but small market (expand scope)

---

## THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT THING

**Get 10 paying customers in 90 days.**

Not users. Not subscribers. Not "interested" people.

10 people who gave you money for this thing.

Everything else is noise until you have that.
