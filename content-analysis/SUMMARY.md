## Detailed Findings by Category

### Platform Compliance Pages (HireVue, Workday, Indeed, LinkedIn, Greenhouse)
**Average Entity Coverage:** 2.8%  
**Status:** Needs significant entity enrichment  

All platform pages are under-performing on entity coverage compared to competitors. These pages need:
- More specific technical details about each platform's AI features
- References to actual compliance requirements and regulations
- Case studies and implementation examples
- Integration guidance and best practices

### State Law Pages (NYC, Illinois, California, Colorado, etc.)
**Average Entity Coverage:** 7.4%  
**Status:** Mixed performance, some critical gaps  

State law pages show wide variance:
- **Best performers:** Illinois (14.9%), Colorado (13.9%)
- **Needs work:** California (0.0%), Washington (0.3%), Texas (1.6%)

California page has zero entity coverage - this is a critical issue for a major state law page.

### Federal & International (EEOC, Federal, EU AI Act)
**Average Entity Coverage:** 7.4%  
**Status:** Moderate coverage, needs depth  

Federal pages have better structure but lack:
- Specific citations and regulatory references
- Historical context and case law
- Detailed compliance procedures
- International comparison frameworks

### Foundational Guides (What Counts as AI, Compliance Checklist, etc.)
**Average Entity Coverage:** 3.9%  
**Status:** Critical foundation pages need strengthening  

These are high-traffic pages that need the most attention:
- FAQ page has only 77 words (critical issue)
- What Counts as AI: only 629 words
- Compliance Checklist: 971 words but low entity coverage

### Implementation Pages (Program Guide, Training, Vendor Assessment)
**Average Entity Coverage:** 43.9%  
**Status:** Best performing category  

Implementation pages show stronger entity coverage, especially vendor-assessment-guide (125%). These pages have good structure and can serve as models for others.

### Commercial Pages (EmployArmor vs Competitors)
**Average Entity Coverage:** 266.7%  
**Status:** Over-optimized, may need balance  

These pages have extremely high entity coverage (500% and 125%), suggesting they may be over-optimized or competitors have thin content. Review for quality vs. keyword stuffing.

## Next Steps

### 1. **Critical Fixes (This Week)**
- **FAQ page:** Expand from 77 words to 2000+ words with comprehensive Q&A
- **California page:** Complete rewrite - zero entity coverage is unacceptable for major state
- **Washington & Texas pages:** Add substantial content - both under 2% coverage
- **Foundation pages:** Expand "What Counts as AI" and "Compliance Checklist" with examples

### 2. **High Priority Enhancements (Next 2 Weeks)**
- **Platform pages (5):** Add 500-1000 words each with specific technical details
- **Entity gaps:** Add top 10 missing entities across high-traffic pages
- **Category alignment:** 19 pages need better topical category coverage
- **State law depth:** Add regulatory citations, penalties, and compliance procedures

### 3. **Medium Priority (Next Month)**
- **Salience optimization:** 17 pages need entity emphasis adjustments
- **Internal linking:** Connect pages with shared entities
- **Visual content:** Add diagrams, flowcharts, checklists (won't help NLP but helps users)
- **Update frequency:** Establish monthly review cadence for regulatory changes

### 4. **Long-term Content Strategy (Ongoing)**
- **Target entity coverage:** Aim for 40-60% vs competitors (realistic benchmark)
- **Word count targets:** 
  - Foundation pages: 2000-3000 words
  - State/platform pages: 1500-2500 words  
  - Implementation pages: 1200-2000 words
- **Competitor monitoring:** Re-run NLP analysis quarterly
- **User feedback integration:** Track which pages convert and double down on winners
